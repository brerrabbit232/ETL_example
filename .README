This project is a simple exhibition of an JSON API->MySQL ETL, 
wrapped into a humble PHP MVC.

There are some data validation steps taken in each layer of 
this example, but they are by no means complete. Further, no 
test harness is presented for the ETL contained in this project, 
and such a device should surely be formally developed and present 
to accompany production code. Said simply: I've limited time.

The project first makes an API call to the National Hockey League 
(NHL, https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/) to fetch a list of teams.

Users then select their favorite team and submit an HTML form.

Content of this submission is used to form a second API call to the
NHL which retrieves the seleted team's current roster of players, along
their boolean status as team captain, and their birthday.

Users are then informed of their seleted team's captain (or captains, or
absence thereof, as are all in regular practice from one club to the next), 
their birthday, and the count of days from the present date to the captain's
next birthday.
